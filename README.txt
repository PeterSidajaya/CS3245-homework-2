== General Notes about this assignment ==

INDEXING

The indexing process is contained in index.py, with spimi.py containing the helper functions.
The process begins with by inverting the documents in blocks which size is determined beforehand.
In each blocks, the documents are indexed into a dictionary and a collection of posting lists, which
is put inside a posting file. The resulting blocks are then merged two by two until one set of
dictionary and posting files are left. Finally, skip pointers are added to the posting lists.

When running the process, make sure that the correct BLOCK_SIZE is set. If it is too small,
the indexing process will take ages. Conversely, if it is too large, the memory might not be able
to handle. A BLOCK_SIZE of 1,000 is a safe bet.

SEARCHING

The searching process is contained in search.py, with query.py containing the helper functions.
In the query process, the queries are first put into the shunting-yard algorithm, which will return
the query as a queue in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). The queue can then be processed directly,
using set operations. The set operations are also sped up using skip pointers.

POSTING LIST

We implement the posting list using a normal Python list. The format of the elements of the posting list is
(int element, boolean have_skip_pointers, int pointer). pointer will be None if have_skip_pointers is False.

REMARKS

We assume the query to be sensical, e.g., no "AND NOT AND OR NOT".
Operators are case-sensitive ("NOT NOT and OR or" would still work).
